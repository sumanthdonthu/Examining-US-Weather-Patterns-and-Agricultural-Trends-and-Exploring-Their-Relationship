## Examining US Weather Patterns and Agricultural Trends and Exploring Their Relationship
Agriculture is a critical sector influenced by climate conditions, and understanding these dynamics is vital for the agricultural community, policymakers, and stakeholders.
This project aims to assess the historical trends in US weather patterns(temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events) and agricultural outcomes(yield and land usage).
This research will also identify trends, assess the impact of extreme weather occurrences, and provide insights for informed decision-making.
